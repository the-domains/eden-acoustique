TÔMEI - OPEN AIR DESIGN LOUDSPEAKERS

Many, many years have gone by since the first loudspeaker appeared. Nowadays, boxes of all sizes have become a necessary evil when integration to a lifestyle decor is needed. Eden Acoustique decided to break _some_ rules, omitting such mundane things as a housing for the speakers. No more box, not even a baffle in sight! The TÔMEI and the OPEN AIR DESIGN (OAD) were born. Live, holographic, 3D, multi-layered soundstage, outstanding, exciting, ... Everyone has a way to describe them!
