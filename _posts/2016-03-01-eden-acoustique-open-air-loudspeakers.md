TÔMEI - OPEN AIR DESIGN LOUDSPEAKERS

Many, many years have gone by since the first domestic loudspeaker appeared. Nowadays, boxes of all sizes have become a necessary evil when integration to a lifestyle decor is needed. At Eden Acoustique such mundane things as a housing for the speakers have been omitted. No more box, not even a baffle in sight! The TÔMEI and the OPEN AIR DESIGN (OAD) were born. Live, holographic, 3D, multi-layered soundstage, outstanding, exciting, ... Everyone has a way to describe them!

LIVE CONCERT OR CINEMA SHOW?

With TÔMEI, no need for pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, DACs, nor loudspeaker cables. Just plug your computer to the USB input of our TÔMEI AIR control unit and run your preferred HD Audio software application. Using your intelligent phone or tablet just take control from anywhere in the house.

Looking for an exciting cinema night, just plug your TV to the analog or digital input and enjoy thunderous bass, incredible 3D rendering of sound effects, enter the movie!
